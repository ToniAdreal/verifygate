# VerifyGate

**AI proposes. Deterministic checks dispose. The evidence record proves it.**

VerifyGate is a pre-delivery verification harness for coding agents. A coding
agent (or a human) submits a code change plus a task spec; VerifyGate runs
the spec's deterministic checks — unit tests, reproduction scripts,
lint/type gates — in a sandboxed copy of the candidate, and only artifacts
that pass receive a signed, replayable **evidence record**.

The LLM (NVIDIA Nemotron via Nebius Token Factory) may *propose* patches and
*explain* failures. It never decides PASS/FAIL. Verdicts come only from
deterministic validators: exit codes and assertions.

## Quickstart (Judge Mode — zero keys, zero network)

```bash
# Passing candidate
python3 -m verifygate run --spec samples/spec.json \
    --candidate samples/passing --mode judge --out evidence-passing.json
# -> VERDICT: PASS

# Failing candidate (intentionally broken slugify)
python3 -m verifygate run --spec samples/spec.json \
    --candidate samples/failing --mode judge --out evidence-failing.json
# -> VERDICT: FAIL, with a diagnosis entry in the evidence record
```

Judge Mode swaps the LLM for a deterministic mock adapter: every validator
still runs for real — only the *words* (patch proposals, explanations) are
template-rendered. A FAIL record is a deliverable, not an error: it carries
the diagnosis meant to feed the next repair iteration.

The sample candidates' own checks use `pytest` (the sample library's test
suite); VerifyGate itself is standard-library only.

## Real mode (Nebius Token Factory)

```bash
export NEBIUS_API_KEY=...        # Token Factory API key
export NEBIUS_MODEL=...          # a Nemotron instruct model on Token Factory
export TAVILY_API_KEY=...        # optional: live references in diagnoses
python3 -m verifygate run --spec samples/spec.json \
    --candidate samples/passing --mode real
```

## Task spec format

```json
{
  "name": "stringtools-slugify-fix",
  "brief": "Fix slugify() so it lowercases, strips punctuation, hyphenates.",
  "checks": [
    {"name": "unit_tests",   "command": "python3 -m pytest -q", "timeout_s": 60},
    {"name": "repro_script", "command": "python3 repro.py",     "timeout_s": 30}
  ]
}
```

## Evidence records

Each run emits a JSON record binding the spec hash, the candidate tree
hash, and every check result (command, exit code, duration, output tails).
Entries are hash-chained and the record hash is HMAC-signed
(`VERIFYGATE_SIGNING_KEY`; a clearly-labelled public dev key is the
default). `verifygate.evidence.verify_chain()` detects any edit, and the
record's `replay` field is the exact command to reproduce the verdict.

## Layout

```
verifygate/   spec, sandbox, validators, evidence, llm adapters, cli
samples/      fictional demo task + passing / failing candidates
tests/        pytest suite for VerifyGate itself
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
